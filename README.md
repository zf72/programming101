Hey great success! I've taken a look at your handywork in our github project and it's excellent!!!

I love it!

In fact, it was clever and I saw the image on the page with the broken image icon and was like... hmmm... maybe he screwed up his image reference or something.. so I peeked at your code and NO! You did it! Great! LAUGH! It was by design! Love it.

Kudos my friend, nice work!

Now, I've added a homework5 "issue" to github that describes what I want you to do next, which will help you understand a couple things:
1. Use of CSS
2. Good web development practices around pre-loading images

Pre-loading can be good. It creates a better experience so that the image is already loaded when you display it to the user. The webpage will still download the image from the file you point the img tag to in the src attribute even if you hide the image with CSS.

Anyway, have a stab at the homework and lemme know if you get stuck.

Lookin good!

We're getting closer.

Feel free to add another awesome Aaron "flourish" to your solution. I like the laugh!

Next phase of this, now that you've got some of this down will be to jQuery I think, but first let me know where you're at in your reading / learning on your own and what you think the next direction that would make sense would be for you?

Cheers!
